PiOmxTextures (POT)
===================
This is a proof of concept of how to build a QML Qt component that renders h264 1080p
video and audio using Raspberry Pi hardware decoder. Also contains code to hardware-decode
images to QML components.

In the piomxtextures_qt_driver there is a QtMultimedia backend sample using POT as a shared
library.

In piomxtextures_poxplayer there is a sample player used to test the backend.

For more information on the project refer to http://goo.gl/KphzdD.<br/>
For some build instructions: http://goo.gl/9TZPxn.<br/>
For some info on how to use: http://goo.gl/TuiSyS.

For a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeJxQN-W2uA.

POT releases include builds that include Qt Backend, POT library, sample apps and Qt builds that include most available Qt modules and rare complete firmware images.
I'll keep the project up as long as I'll see interest for it. Enjoy! ;-)
